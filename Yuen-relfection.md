What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Git fetch and Git merge when dealing online repositories

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Git fetch and git merge 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
To clarify git fetch and git merge vs git pull and their proper syntax

What still confuses you about Git?
For me personally it would be envisioning how things would work with a team on the same repository.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was good. We went through the assignment and we had lots of discussion about the assignment. It's good to hear from another person their view on a specific topic and how they would explain it. It helped me understand things that I was doubting myself in.

Having the guide there was really helpful as we can refer to him for things that we didn't understand. He was really insightful and saved us a bit of time. He also let us try to solve the problem first before helping us.
